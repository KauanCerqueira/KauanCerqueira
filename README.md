# Kauan Cerqueira

Senior Software Engineer  
Automation • Backend • SaaS • AI-driven Systems

I design and build production-grade systems focused on automation, backend engineering,
and SaaS platforms. My work involves complex workflows, external integrations,
and AI-assisted pipelines designed for reliability, scalability, and long-term evolution.

I usually work end-to-end — from system design and architecture
to implementation, monitoring, and operational stability.
